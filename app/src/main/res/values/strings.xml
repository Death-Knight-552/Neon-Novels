    <string name="placeholder_synopsis">Sei, a 20 year old office worker was summoned to a different world after finishing some overtime work. But the person who had summoned her looked at her face and said, “This is not the Saint.” Is this neglect play!?

Sei left the royal palace and concealed her saint title. She started working at a laboratory where she made potions and cosmetics. She used her magic to grant people’s requests and slowly people began suspecting that she was a saint…

Can Sei enjoy her slow dreamy different world life without her saint title being found out?!
